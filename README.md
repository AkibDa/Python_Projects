## Contents

This repository is organized by topic.  Each folder represents a specific area of Python I've explored.

*   **`basics`**: Contains files covering basic syntax, data types (integers, floats, strings, lists, dictionaries, tuples), operators, variables, and control flow (if/else statements, loops).  Look for files like `variables.py`, `data_types.py`, `loops.py`, etc.
*   **`functions`**: Examples and explanations of defining and using functions, including parameters, return values, and scope.  Files might include `functions_intro.py`, `function_arguments.py`.
*   **`oop`**: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming in Python.  This folder explores classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.  Expect files like `classes_objects.py`, `inheritance.py`.
*   **`modules`**:  Examples of using built-in Python modules and installing external libraries using `pip`.  Files might demonstrate working with modules like `math`, `random`, `datetime`, or requests.
*   **`data_structures`**: Implementation and usage of common data structures like lists, dictionaries, sets, and potentially more advanced ones like stacks and queues.
*   **`projects`**:  Small projects that combine the concepts learned in the other folders.  These could be simple games, scripts, or utilities.  (e.g., `simple_calculator.py`).
